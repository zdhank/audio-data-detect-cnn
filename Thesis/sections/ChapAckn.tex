First of all, I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my advisor Dr. Krystian Mikolajczyk who discussed the results and gave me useful advice all the time. His excellent guidance helped me to accomplish my project.\par
I would also like to thank Miss. Jenna Lawson whose contribution in labelling large amount of raw audio data. With her support, the project could make progress step by step. Special gratitude goes to Mr. Duncan Bulter for his previous work on this topic, which provided guidance as a baseline to my project. \par
Finally, I appreciated the help of my parents and friends, who gave me large encouragement and support during the project.
